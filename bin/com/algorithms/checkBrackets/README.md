# Check Brackets

### Given a string containing just the characters ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘{’, ‘}’, ‘[’ and ‘]’, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
#### - Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
#### - Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
#### - Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

```java
input: "()[]{}"
output: true

input: "{[()]}"
output: true

input: "[(])"
output: false
```
