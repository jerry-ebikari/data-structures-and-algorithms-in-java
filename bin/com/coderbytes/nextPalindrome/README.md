# Next Palindrome

### Have the function NextPalindrome(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the next largest palindromic number. The input can be any positive integer. For example: if num is 24, then your program should return 33 because that is the next largest number that is a palindrome.

```java
Input: 2
Output: 3

Input: 180
Output: 181
```
