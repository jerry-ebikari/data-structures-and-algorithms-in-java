# AB Check

### Have the function ABCheck(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string true if the characters a and b are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at leastonce (ie. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). Otherwise return the string false.

```java
Input: "after badly"
Output: false

Input: "Laura sobs"
Output: true
```
